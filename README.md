## Authentication and Configuration

Using Huawei Cloud product-related skills requires authentication configuration. The following authentication methods are supported:

### Interactive Configuration

```bash
Access Key Id: <your AK>
Secret Access Key: <your SK>
```

### AccessKey Authentication

```bash
# Set credentials via command
hcloud configure set --cli-access-key="<your AK>" --cli-secret-key="<your SK>" --cli-mode="AKSK"
```

**Security Tips**

- **`AccessKey Authentication`** and **`AK credential authentication in KooCLI configuration files`** are recommended only for personal use in local testing environments to avoid exposing plaintext AK/SK credentials.
- For cloud service environments, it is strongly recommended to follow the security requirements in [Huawei Cloud Command Line Tool Service KooCLI](https://support.huaweicloud.com/productdesc-hcli/hcli_26_002.html).
